    "In short, a programming language is the way in which a computer programmer talks to a device. If you know how to speak one of these languages and there are hundreds you can create a program that can perform tasks. These can range from the very simple, like a script that moves a file from one place to another, to the very complex, like rendering a 3D world in a video game.")

In this sentence, you know exactly who gave what and to whom; change the words around and you get a different sentence: Fred gave Gary a book That still makes sense, but if you say a book to Gary Fred gave we have a problem on our hands.")

    "Roughly speaking, programming languages fall into two categories: low-level and high-level languages. Low-level languages are called that because they are closs to the machine, they can speak to it directly. This includes machine language and assembly languages, which are programming languages that are only a little removed from binary.")
st.markdown(
    "High-level languages are a step above low-level languages. They're further away from the machine, but are readable by humans. Readable in this case means that if you know the language in question you can look at a few lines of code and figure out what's going on. This also works the other way around: you can type up commands which will then be executed by the machine")
